## Code of Conduct

Be cooperative when you ask for help. We will spend time helping you for free,
so be please ready to spend your time too:
 * Read the server documentation and [Troubleshooting](doc/Troubleshooting.md)
   guide first to see if you can resolve the issue yourself.
 * Describe thoroughly the issue you are having and include (only the) relevant
   portions of server logs.
 * Be ready to repeat the course of actions against latest server binaries to
   generate more debug information or verify the bugfix.
 * Be ready to investigate behaviour of your device or gateway. These can be
   faulty too.

Be respectful to the maintainers and other contributors. Open source contributors
put long hours into developing projects and doing user support. Those projects
and user support are available for free. We believe this deserves some respect.
